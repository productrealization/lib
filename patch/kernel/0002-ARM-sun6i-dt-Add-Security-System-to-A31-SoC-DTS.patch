Subject: [PATCH 2/8] ARM: sun6i: dt: Add Security System to A31 SoC DTS

The Security System is a hardware cryptographic accelerator that support
AES/MD5/SHA1/DES/3DES/PRNG algorithms.
It could be found on many Allwinner SoC.

This patch enable the Security System on the Allwinner A31 SoC Device-tree.
